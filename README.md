Data Management
==========
by CÃ©sar Herrera


This presentation was prepared for a [codeRtsv](https://codertsv.github.io) meet-up.

The presentation was created using the amazing [reveal.js](https://revealjs.com) project, and it is hosted in GitHub Pages in this [link]().


## Inspiration

There are many sources who have inspired me to prepare slides in this topic. Moreover, many ideas and literature referenced through the presentation were borrowed from others. A special mention to [Richard McElreath](https://xcelab.net/rm/) and his presentation [Science as Amateur Software Development](https://youtu.be/zwRdO9_GGhY). In this presentation, he expressed fluidly many of the inconsistencies around data management in science, and how to improve our data management practices by implementing a set of professional norms (just as software developers, and everyone else seems to do).


## Contributions

Please feel free to improve this presentation and submit Pull requests. I am also happy to know about your own experience, and advice in how to practice good and effective data management.
