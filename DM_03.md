## Conclusions

Encouraging old scientist to follow this practice is very hard, and some of them might feel insulted. 

It is paramount that the current and next generation of scientists embrace good practices to managing data.


Pre-register your experiment

Can the statistical analysis and data to be collected probe the proposed hypothesis?

 - Express theory as a model
 - Use algorithms to probe planned analysis
 - Create synthetic data and test the pipeline
 - If all goes well, use real data


* Responsible
* Transparent
* When mistakes are discovered, we can go back and find the source of the mistake and learn consequences to our knowledge.


This type of norms should be part of our professional formation, and often these are not taught:

- How to organize your data
- How to curate data (how to continuously integrate new data and maintain integrity and intelligibility)
- How to test data and procedures (scientifically pipelines can be tested)
- Manage distributed contributions - continues integration of different data sources into a common body of knowledge.
